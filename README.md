# nfa019CalendarAppProject

This is the container for the CalendarAppProject (CNAM - NFA-019)

It is an Exercice of programmation with Java / Swing for the Front-end and MySql (jdbc) for the back-end.

No real design pattern has been applied, but the structure was builed (via class and others diagrams) and exported with StarUml.

It consists on an interactive calendar.

In the actual state, you can turn pages to the last or next month. You can also insert, update, or delete an activity for the selected day. 

You can define the date, the activity and also its status ('to do', 'running', 'in test', 'finished') in a form Frame and the color of its item will magically change :)

To create an activity, you can clic on a button on the main panel. You can also choose to clic directly to the day item itself to create, suppress, or modifie an activity as well...

Everything seems to work fine, in the actual state.

To be augmented, it would make sense (to me, however...) to give the hability to select a date range (or maybe... many).

Also, the Sonarqube gives me a bunch of errors i have not finished to resolve...

Well, thanks for your interest, and (maybe) contributions...
